# 🖌️ Paint Clone in C with CSFML

_A lightweight clone of the classic Windows Paint tool, built in **C** using the **CSFML** library._

---

## 📌 Overview

This project recreates the core features of **MS Paint** to demonstrate my skills in:

- **C programming** (low-level memory management, modular architecture)
- **Graphics rendering & event handling** with CSFML
- **User interface design** with interactive tools
- **File operations** (saving & loading images)

It’s a fully interactive desktop application (binary program) showcasing my ability to build real-world software from scratch.

## 🎨 Features

- 🖋️ **Drawing tools**: Pen, brush, and eraser
- 🎨 **Color picker** with multiple color options
- 🖼️ **Canvas** for freehand drawing
- 💾 **Save & load** drawings as image files
- 🔄 **Clear canvas** functionality

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C
- **Graphics/Input:** CSFML
- **Build Tool:** Makefile
- **OS Compatibility:** Linux / Windows / macOS

Use the following command to install the CSFML library on your computer or refer to their official website [CSML](https://26.customprotocol.com/csfml/index.htm) for more details.
````shell

## 🎥 Demo

To run this program, a simple ````make```` will build the binary and you just need to execute the following command to start playing:
````shell
./my_paint
````
At the root of the repository or the program won't be able to load the assets correctly.
